THE MAZE PROJECT - MVP
(A 3D Game created using SDL2)

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Maze Game with SDL2:


Explanation:
Walls: Create a 2D array to represent the maze and draw walls using SDL2 graphics library. The walls should be represented by rectangles or lines.
Define a 2D array to store the maze data.

Use SDL2 graphics library to draw walls by rendering rectangles or lines.

Orientation: Use the arrow keys to control the movement and rotation of the player in the maze. You can use SDL_Event to handle user input.
Implement a function to handle user input using SDL_Event.

Update the player's position and orientation based on the input received from the user.

Move: Implement basic movement logic for the player. Allow the player to move forward, backward, left, and right in the maze.
Implement a function to update the player's position based on the current orientation and input received from the user.

Ouch: Add collision detection between the player and the walls. The player should not be able to move through the walls. If the player collides with a wall, stop the player's movement.

Implement a function to check for collision between the player and the walls.

If the player collides with a wall, stop the player's movement.

Parser: Create a simple parser to read the maze data from a text file and store it in a 2D array.

Implement a function to read the maze data from a text file.

Store the maze data in the 2D array.

Draw the Map: Draw the maze using the maze data stored in the 2D array. You can use different colors for the walls and ground/ceiling to make them visually distinct.

Use the maze data stored in the 2D array to draw the maze.

Use different colors to distinguish between the walls and ground/ceiling.

Textures: Add basic textures to the walls using SDL2's texture rendering functions.

Implement a function to load wall textures.

Use SDL2's texture rendering functions to render textures on the walls.

These are the minimum features required to implement a basic maze game with SDL2.

USER STORY

- Play the Maze Game
As an end user, I want to play a maze game using SDL2, so that I can have fun solving the maze and challenge myself to improve my speed and accuracy.

- Main Menu Options
As an end user, when I start the game, I want to see a main menu with options to start a new game, load a saved game, or quit the game. If I choose to start a new game, I want to select the difficulty level of the maze, including its size and the number of obstacles.

- In-Game Experience
As an end user, once the game starts, I want to see a maze on the screen with a character that I can control using the arrow keys. I want the character to move smoothly and quickly, without any lag or delay. I also want to see a timer that counts down the time I have to complete the maze, and a score that reflects my progress through the maze.

- Collect Rewards
As an end user, while navigating through the maze, I want to collect coins or other rewards to increase my score. I also want to encounter obstacles that will slow me down or make it harder to reach the end of the maze.

- Game Completion
As an end user, when I reach the end of the maze, I want to see a congratulatory message that displays my final score and the time it took me to complete the maze. I also want the option to save my game, so that I can come back and play again later.

- Audio Feedback
As an end user, I want to hear sound effects that correspond to my actions, such as collecting coins or hitting obstacles. I also want to hear music that adds to the excitement and challenge of the game.

- Visual Appeal
As an end user, I want the game to be visually appealing, with high-quality graphics and animations that make it fun to play and keep me engaged throughout the game.
